## Week 2 — Team Integration & Setup

Over the past two weeks, I have been integrated into the **project team**, where we've shared our *skills, interests, and roles* to ensure smooth collaboration moving forward.  

As a team, we set up a **Trello board** to track timelines, deadlines, task assignments, and priorities. We also established a **Discord server** for efficient communication, file sharing, and meeting coordination.

My focus has been on familiarizing myself with the **Top-Down Game Template** and the **Inventory System**. I’ve gained an understanding of the Unity engine and the specific version we are using for the project. In addition, I have reviewed the **inventory API documentation** to prepare for implementing new features, such as the cooking system and new ingredients.  

Additionally, I helped coordinate our team’s schedule, reminding everyone about the importance of regular meetings to stay on track and ensure we meet deadlines.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Continue refining my understanding of Unity  
- Begin implementing new features  
- Contribute to keeping the team organized and focused

## Week 4 — Defining Core Systems

Over the past two weeks, our team has **finalised the scope** of our project and developed key gameplay systems. We focused on defining how the **diet system** and **transformation mechanics** will function.  

My primary contribution has been creating **editable recipe objects** in Unity, allowing the team to add and modify recipes directly in the Inspector while I continue developing the underlying code and scripting for gameplay functionality.  

In addition, I have been exploring **animations and game mechanics** to support the transformation process, ensuring that these elements integrate smoothly into the final gameplay experience. While these systems are still in a rough form, establishing a working foundation has been crucial for maintaining project momentum.  

The team also dedicated time to preparing for our **upcoming pitch**, finalising the script and clarifying who will present each section, aiming to deliver a professional and cohesive presentation.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Refine the diet and transformation systems  
- Integrate animations and test gameplay interactions  
- Support the team in finalising pitch assets and update documentation

## Week 6 — UI Improvements & Cooking System

This past week, I focused on several **improvements to the game’s UI and mechanics**.  

One of the major updates was adding a **"Cook" button** to the user interface, making it easier for players to interact with the cooking system. Although I’ve integrated the button, the implementation is still ongoing as I refine the interaction logic and ensure it functions properly within the gameplay flow.  

Additionally, I developed a feature that generates a **"Failed Meal"** item when the player attempts to create a dish that doesn’t match any available recipes. This adds *complexity and realism* by rewarding accuracy and challenging experimentation.  

Throughout the week, I also participated in team meetings and classes where we discussed project progress and clarified technical challenges, helping refine my approach to implementation.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Complete the "Cook" button functionality  
- Expand the recipe system with more meal options  
- Keep documentation up to date

## Week 8 — Optimization & Version Control

I upgraded the **template** so that it consumes fewer resources when using the inventory system. The program now runs more **efficiently and smoothly**.  

I also added **type safety** and finished the **transfer from GitHub to Unity Version Control**. My team had difficulty managing GitHub in a way that preserved version integrity, so I led the transition to Unity’s native system.  

This change allows the team to use the **Unity Inspector** directly for versioning, making it far more intuitive for other developers. It took a learning curve, but our workflow and versioning efficiency have **improved dramatically**.

## Week 10 — Cooking System Completed

I finished the **cooking system**. Now the player can **cook an item**, and it creates **new items** in the inventory.  

I also fixed a **bug** where one item was transforming into a different item when dropped.  

Looking ahead, I am exploring **eating mechanics and a dieting system** for our player, allowing **food buffs** to be gained from cooked meals.

## Week 12 — Refinements, Integrations & New Mechanics

Over the past fortnight, I refined the **cooking system** to improve *performance, reliability, and player feedback*. This included optimizing how ingredients are validated and ensuring recipe outcomes are consistently generated in the inventory system. These updates make the cooking process **smoother and more intuitive**, enhancing the overall player experience.  

I also integrated the **More Mountains code updates** into our project, improving compatibility with our custom systems and reducing code conflicts. This upgrade **streamlined our workflow** and made future feature additions easier to manage.  

A major milestone this week was the implementation of the **eating mechanic**, enabling players to consume cooked meals for **buffs and stat effects**. This ties directly into the diet and transformation systems developed earlier, bringing the gameplay loop closer to completion.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Polish eating system animations  
- Balance stat effects and test meal interactions  
- Maintain up-to-date documentation
