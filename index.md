Week 2 Development Blog

Over the past two weeks, I have been integrated into the project team, where we've shared our skills, interests, and roles to ensure smooth collaboration moving forward. As a team, we set up a Trello board to track timelines, deadlines, task assignments, and priorities. We also established a Discord server for efficient communication, file sharing, and meeting coordination.

My focus has been on familiarizing myself with the game templates, particularly the Top-Down Game template and the Inventory System. I’ve gained an understanding of the Unity engine and the specific version we are using for the project. In addition, I have reviewed the documentation for the inventory API to prepare for implementing new features, such as the cooking system, as well as new ingredients. This will enable me to contribute effectively when the time comes to add custom functionality to the game.

Additionally, I helped coordinate our team’s schedule, reminding everyone about the importance of regular meetings to stay on track and ensure we meet deadlines. Over the next two weeks, I will continue refining my understanding of Unity, begin implementing new features, and contribute to keeping the team organized and focused.

Week 4 Development Blog
Over the past two weeks, our team has finalised the scope of our project and further developed key gameplay systems. We focused on defining how the diet system and transformation mechanics will function. My primary contribution has been creating editable recipe objects in Unity, allowing the team to add and modify recipes directly in the inspector while I continue developing the underlying code and scripting for gameplay functionality.

In addition, I have been exploring animations and game mechanics to support the transformation process, ensuring that these elements will integrate smoothly into the final gameplay experience. While these systems are still in a rough form, establishing a working foundation has been crucial for maintaining project momentum.

The team has also dedicated time to preparing for our upcoming pitch. We have been finalising the pitch script and clarifying who will present each section, aiming to deliver a professional and cohesive presentation.

For the coming fortnight, I plan to continue refining the diet and transformation systems, integrating animations, and testing gameplay interactions to ensure they function as intended. I will also support the team in finalising any remaining assets required for the pitch, while continuing to update documentation to reflect progress and decisions made.

Week 6 Development
This past week, I focused on several improvements to the game’s UI and mechanics. One of the major updates was adding a "Cook" button to the user interface, making it easier for players to interact with the cooking system. Although I’ve integrated the button, the implementation is still ongoing, as I am refining the interaction logic and ensuring the button functions as intended within the broader gameplay flow.

Additionally, I developed a feature that generates a "Failed Meal" item when the player attempts to create a dish that doesn’t match any of the available recipes. This will help to add a layer of complexity and realism to the game by rewarding players who successfully follow recipes and challenging them when they make incorrect combinations.

Throughout the week, I also participated in a number of team meetings and attended classes, where we discussed project progress and clarified technical challenges. These discussions helped me refine my approach to the implementation of new features and keep the development process on track.

Looking ahead, my focus for the next fortnight will be on completing the "Cook" button functionality, as well as expanding the recipe system to include additional meal options. I will also continue to keep the project documentation up to date with the latest changes.




Week 8 Development

I upgraded the template so that it consumes fewer resources to use the inventory system. The program now runs more efficiently and smoothly. I also added type safety and finished the transfer from GitHub to Unity version control. My team was struggling to figure out how to use GitHub effectively in a way that would not harm the versioning we currently had, so I made the transition to Unity so we can use the inspector inside of Unity and make it more native for the other devs. It's taken a learning curve, but I've seen the efficiency of our changes and versioning improve dramatically.


Week 10 Development
I finished the cooking system. Now the player can cook an item, and it creates new items in the inventory. Also fixed a bug where one item was transforming to a different item when dropped. I am looking towrd how to make the eating mechanics and a dieting system for our player so we can get food buffs from cooked meals.
